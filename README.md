Tiny bash script to automate shuffle-play on my CCTV monitor - its only really here for reference.

I use this in my bedroom with a repurposed CCTV monitor hooked up to a raspberry pi to shuffle play my large folder of short 2-20 second idents upon the click of an infrared remote (which calls the script).
